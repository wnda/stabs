This is a bizarre implementation of tabs in JavaScript.

This is not exactly a well-formed module or plugin, but it will pick up any designated tab-container element on launch and it will enable tabbed navigation successfully for each case.

tabcontainers can be nested, so if for some insane reason you want tabs in a tab pane, it'll work.

performance, well, it's not horribly slow, but I'm sure it could do with improvement.
