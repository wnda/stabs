This is a weird and bad implementation of tabs in JavaScript.

It's not a well-formed module or plugin

but it will pick up any designated tab-container element and it will enable tabbed navigation successfully in each case.

tab-containers can be nested, so if for some insane reason you want tabs in a tab pane, it'll work.

performance, well, it's not bad, but I'm sure it could do with improvement.

it's 50 lines before minification.
